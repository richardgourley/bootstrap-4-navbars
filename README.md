# Bootstrap 4 Navbar Examples

These examples build upon the example navbars in the Bootstrap 4 documentation.

The basic-navbar.html file which has a brand name and menu on the left of a full width navbar.  It doesn't have any modified elements.
I start with the navbar in the basic-navbar.html file and build upon that with each navbar example added. 
These examples are a reference and aim to help bootstrap users:
## Understand which elements you need to modify to change the colors of your navbar, including links.
## Understand how to use built in bootstrap classes to modify parts of the navbar.
## Create various navbar layouts such as menu left, menu center with brandnames above.

It's not a complete bootstrap 4 navbar guide but hopefully acts as a way to see how adding and slightly modifying parts of the bootstrap navbar can help you achieve the navbar you want for your next web app.
