# Bootstrap 4 Navbar Examples

These bootstrap 4 navbar examples all build upon a basic navbar found in basic-navbar.html which has a simple brand name and menu on the left with a drop down menu included for one of the items.  It includes a button which is used for the drop down menu.  (This is never modified in any example.)

Modifying navbars using Bootstrap 4 can seem quite daunting but by using a combination of built in bootstrap classes and knowing exactly which elements to modify and when, users can use these examples as a guide to create a unique navbar for their next project.
