# Bootstrap 4 Navbar Examples

These examples build upon the example navbars in the Bootstrap 4 documentation.

Each example builds upon the basic-navbar.html file which has a brand name and menu on the left of a standard navbar which is fluid (full width).

Here in this file, you can see which elements we have altered for each navbar file example.
